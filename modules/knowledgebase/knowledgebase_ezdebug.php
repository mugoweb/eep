# Determines whether the templates should be compiled to PHP code, by enabling this the loading

# Note: The first time the templates are compiled it will take a long time, use the

TemplateCache=disabled
# Controls if development is enabled or not.
# When enabled the system will perform more checks like modification time on
# compiled vs source file and will reduce need for clearing template compiled
# files.
# Note: Live sites should not have this enabled since it increases file access
#       and can be slower.
# Note: When switching this setting the template compiled files must be cleared.
